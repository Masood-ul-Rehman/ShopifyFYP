🚀 Excited to Share Our Final Year Project: E-commerce Store with MERN Stack! 🛍️
I am thrilled to present the culmination of months of hard work and dedication - our Final Year Project!
🎓 Working alongside my talented teammate, Waris Ansar, we developed an E-commerce Store with a powerful backend and a user-friendly frontend.
🌐 Our project offers a seamless experience for users to create their own online stores, effectively acting as personalized websites for their clients. Here are some of the key features we've implemented:
🛒 User Signup and Store Creation: Users can easily sign up and create their own stores, enabling them to showcase and sell their products to the world.
🎨 Admin Dashboard: The heart of the platform! With an intuitive admin dashboard, users can effortlessly manage their product inventory, update existing items, add new products, and remove items no longer available.
📈 Order Tracking: Our E-commerce Store ensures that users stay informed about their business. The admin dashboard displays real-time updates on recent orders, empowering users to stay in control.
🧰 Technologies Used:
Frontend: We utilized the power of ReactJS for crafting a responsive and interactive user interface.
Backend: For the backend, we relied on Node.js and Express to create a robust and scalable server.
Database: MongoDB acted as the foundation of our data storage and management, ensuring efficiency and reliability.
